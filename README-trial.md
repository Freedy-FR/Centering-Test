## **Project Overview**

I've been contemplating the 'Airship Battles' concept ever since I started the Code Institute Full-stack development program. When I finished the Python lessons, I was determined to turn this idea into a tangible project. I kicked off the project by creating wireframes and a flowchart to outline the gameplay and design.

The decision to dedicate this project was inspired by the themes of Final Fantasy airships, a beloved and iconic element of the Final Fantasy series.


"Airship Battles" stands out as a gaming project with a distinct set of features:


- **Error Checking Throughout**: The game is designed with robust error checking to ensure a smooth and seamless gaming experience.

- **Feedback on Every Input**: Players receive informative feedback for every action they take, whether it's the correct move or not, enhancing the learning process.

- **Evenly Spaced Text**: Text within the game is thoughtfully arranged to provide a visually pleasing and organized reading experience.

- **Typewriter-Style Text Output**: Enjoy an immersive typewriter-style text presentation, contributing to the overall atmosphere of the game.

- **Seamless Restart**: Begin a new game without needing to use a mouse.

- **Simplicity and Relaxation**: Immerse yourself in a straightforward and relaxing space-themed webpage, complementing the overall gaming experience.


These features were meticulously planned, with some being part of the initial project design (error checking and feedback), while others evolved organically as the project expanded in scope. The final result is a blend of elements aimed at delivering a captivating, enjoyable, and educational gaming experience.
